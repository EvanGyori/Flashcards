What is a vertex stream
#
the list of user defined vertex attributes needed for a shader
#

VAO
#
Vertex Array Object
stores data for each attribute for each vertex to send to the shader
#

VBO
#
Vertex Buffer Object
A buffer that stores the vertex position data
and is used to send to the VAO
#

uv
#
texture coordinate so the graphics card knows which
pixel of the texture to draw for each fragment
#

program
#
Stores shaders to be run on the gpu
#

Homogeneous coordinates
#
consists of four coordinates (x, y, z, w) where the relative point
remains unchanged if the coordinates are multiplied by a common factor

if w = 0 then the coordinates represent some point at infinity
#S
